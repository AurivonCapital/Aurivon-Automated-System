            <p class="font-bold text-slate-900">1. TRADING RISK</p>
            <p>Trading foreign exchange, commodities, and financial derivatives carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you.</p>

            <p class="font-bold text-slate-900">2. PROPRIETARY FIRM MODEL</p>
            <p>Aurivon Capital provides "Project Cheetah" as an evaluation process. Passing the evaluation does not constitute employment. Traders are engaged as independent contractors using proprietary demo accounts until specific performance milestones are met.</p>

            <p class="font-bold text-slate-900">3. HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE</p>
            <p>Any performance results shown on this website are hypothetical. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.</p>

            <p class="font-bold text-slate-900">4. JURISDICTION</p>
            <p>It is the responsibility of the trader to ensure that they are in compliance with their local regulations before purchasing an evaluation.</p>
